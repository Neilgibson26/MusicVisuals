# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Neil Gibson

Student Number: C17438292

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment
This assignment is a cool, funky visual representation of a song by Roisin Murphy called Murphys Law.
It reacts to the sound of the music in multiple ways throughout the  song including the colours of some items, and the size of some items. As it is a funky song I decided to choose vibrant colours throughout and base my design around disco and disco themes. It will start with an intro that renders automatically with the song, introducing me and the song name and artist. Then moving to a disco ball for a few moments to set the scene of the song until the song ups the tempo. After this it will cut to a vinyl record and this is where the audio visuals begin. This will be the main screen throughout now and as the song continues I incremently add more features to the screen that react to the sound until finally finishing with a small reactive outro.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
